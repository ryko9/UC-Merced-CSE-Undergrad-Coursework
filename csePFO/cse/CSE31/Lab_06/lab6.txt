Lab 6 Questions
CSE 31

1.) 2
2.) We have to increment the pointer by 4 and not 1 because words are 32 bits in length. There are 8 bits in one byte, so the next value in the array should be 4 bytes away.
3.) Bugs can be found by using MARS to step through the program line by line
4.) The source pointer is stored temporarily in $at and then moves to $t1 with the load address function
5.) The destination pointer is stored in $at and then moves to $t2 with the load address function
6.) la $9 is the source, la $10 is the destination
7.) Lines 34 ($L6)
8.) 

Line 1. Instruction: addu $8, $8, 1
		Purpose: increment count words copied
		Corresponding C: k++

Line 2. Instruction: sll $3, $8, 2
		Purpose: shifts increment by 4 bytes to get to next element
		Corresponding C: a1 = a3 + source

Line 3. Instruction: addu $2, $3, $9
		Purpose: Increments the address of the source array by 4 bytes forward
		Corresponding C: a1 = a3 + source

Line 4. Instruction: addu $2, $3, $9
		Purpose: Increments the start address of the source array by a specified number of bytes 
		Corresponding C: v0 = v1 + source

Line 5. Instruction: addu $6, $7, $10
		Purpose: Increments the start of the destination array by a specified number of bytes
		Corresponding C: a2 = a3 + dest

Line 6. Instruction: lw $4, 0($2)
		Purpose: To keep track of the source value in source[k] != 0
		Corresponding C: a0 = source[k]

Line 7. Instruction: move $7, $3
		Purpose: moves the byte increment value into variable a3
		Corresponding C: a3 <- v1

Line 8. Instruction: lw $3, 0($5)
		Purpose: set a variable equal to the value at source k to assign to dest[k]
		Corresponding C: v1 = source[k]

Line 9. Instruction: sw $3, 0($6)
		Purpose: write to dest[k]
		Corresponding C: dest[k] = v1

Line 10. Instruction: bne $4, $0, $L6
		 Purpose: Loop to copy words if source[0] != 0
		 Corresponding C: for(a0 != 0)
