    <h1>What is Malware?</h1>
    <p> Malware is a term coined from combining the words 'malicious' and 'software'. Like its name suggests, Malware refers to any software that

    <h1> The History of Ransomeware</h1>
      <h2> AIDS Trojan</h2>
        <p> The first known ransomware was called the AIDS Trojan. It was developed by Joseph L. Popp who was a Harvard biologist in 1989 and was distributed through floppy disks with the malware at the World Health Organization’s International Aids conference. The malware used simple symmetric cryptography to encrypt the files (North and Richardson).
            The ransomware was not very dangerous due to it using a rather simple encryption algorithm.
        </p>
      <h2> Trojan.Gpcoder </h2>
        <p> The first modern ransomware, Trojan.Gpcoder, was in created in 2005, which used a custom symmetric encryption technique. The encryption method was more complex than the one used in the AIDS Trojan, but was still fairly easy to decrypt. It spread using phishing emails disguised as job application. Overall, the ransomware was not a big threat to companies at the time.
        </p>
      <h2> CryptoLocker </h2>
          <p> The most famous ransomware is CyptoLocker which used multiple forms of encryption to encrypt the user’s files. The ransomware was developed in 2013 and caused heavy damage to many computers. Over 500,000 computers were infected with CryptoLocker in May 2014.  In response multiple cybersecurity agencies took down the CryptoLocker distribution servers. FireEye and Fox-IT released the database of the CryptoLocker’s decryption keys to the victims for free. Ransomware is evolving as encryption and decryption improve over the years.
          </p>
      <h2> WannaCry</h2>
          <p> WannaCry is the most recent development in ransomware as itMobileMal was developed in 2017. It encrypted the files through multiple forms of encryption. The danger of this ransomware was its ability to spread to other computers through  the network. It would attack vulnerable Windows machines without the MS17-010 security patch.
      </ul>
    <h1> A Deeper Understanding of WannaCry </h1>
      <p>
        WannaCry is another popular form of ransomware that plagued the healthcare industry.  It used tools created by the NSA to gain backdoor access to computers. It spreads through other computers in the network through the use of a dropper. The dropper is a single file that will gather all the other files of the ransomware. By distributing a single dropper file instead of the full software, WannaCry was able to spread to other computers in a short amount of time.
        <br>
        The Houston State University recreated the WannaCry ransomware to understand it more. They learned that through the download of one file, it will download multiple other files to create the whole WannaCry ransomware (Jones and Shashidhar).  Some of the files creates the list of decrypted files and encrypted files. Another creates the process of encryption of files.  The program replaces and modifies the registry that focuses on taking control of the system. The WannaCry ransomware is quite complex and was hard to completely reverse engineer the software.

    <h2>The Effects of Ransomeware on the Newspaper industry</h2>
      <p>
        The effects of ransomware can be devastating to companies because it creates collateral damage to the company.  The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and the Tribune were all affected by ransomware.  A ransomware called Ryuk disrupted the printing plant of all three publishers’ printing operation (Sanger and Perlroth).  The ransomware caused the printing plant to deliver 20,000 copies of the New York Times a day late. The attack hindered the movement of files in the office that is essential in the printing process. The group who spread the ransomware earned a payout of $380,000 in that month.  Not only is the payment of the ransom a lost in money, but also the effects of being hindered results in more money being lost.
