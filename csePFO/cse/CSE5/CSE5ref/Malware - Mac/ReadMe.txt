To ensure each files can have access to other webpages use the following hyperlink references (href):
Home Page  = "../Malware/index.html"
ComputerWorms = "../ComputerWorms/computerworms.html">
MobileMalware = "../MobileMalware/mobilemalware.html">
Ransomeware = "../Ransomware/ransomware.html">
Trojans = "../Trojans/trojans.html">

The ../Malware/Folder/filename is essential to have because it allows the folder to be located no matter where it is on the computer. The "../" fills the rest of the path to the currently used file's folder so all we need to fill up the path after the Malware folder.
For me(Roderick), the "../ComputerWorms/computerworms.html" will writes "file:///E:/SCHOOL/CSE5/Malware/ComputerWorms/computerworms.html." as the full path.
    It automatically writes the E:/SCHOOL/CSE5/Malware/ as the path to the /ComputerWorms/computerworms.html. The currently used file's folder is the ComputerWorms and the file before it is the Malware Folder and fills the path to the Malware folder.

For others if you download the folder, it will automatically be "Drive Name:/User/Downloads/Malware/ComputerWorms/computerworms.html"
    The Malware folder will be downloaded to the download folder. It fills everything before the ComputerWorms folder, which is the "Drive Name:/User/Downloads/Malware/."

If we used "../Malware/ComputerWorms/computerworms.html", it will say "Drive Name:/User/Downloads/Malware/Malware/ComputerWorms/computerworms.html." because it the folder level before the current folder is Malware.

For images, upload the images into your topic's folder so your html file can have access to it.
I had them in separate folders so we clearly knows who's files are who.
