<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p> Ransomware is a form of malware that has been becoming a popular form of cyberattack in our society. The malware usually locks the user out of the company and holds it “hostage” until the ransom is paid. The malware encrypts the files on your computer and prevents you from gaining access to your files. There have been many cases of large-scale ransomware attacks throughout the years. There are many ways to prevent malware from gaining control of your computer.</p>

<h2> The History of Ransomeware</h2>
<p>
  Ransomware is not exactly a new form of malware and evolved over the years. The first known ransomware was called the AIDS Trojan. It was developed by Joseph L. Popp who was a Harvard biologist that distributed floppy disks with the malware at the World Health Organization’s International Aids conference. The malware used simple symmetric cryptography to encrypt the files (North and Richardson).  The first modern ransomware was in 2005 called Trojan.Gpcoder, which used a custom symmetric encryption technique. It spread using phishing emails disguised as job application. The most famous ransomware is CyptoLocker which used multiple forms of encryption to encrypt the user’s files. Over 500,000 computers were infected with CryptoLocker in May 2014.  In response multiple cybersecurity agencies took down the CryptoLocker distribution servers. FireEye and Fox-IT released the database of the CryptoLocker’s decryption keys to the victims for free. Ransomware is evolving as encryption and decryption improve over the years.

<h3> The Encryption of WannaCry </h3>
<p>
  WannaCry is another popular form of ransomware that plagued the healthcare industry. It is a worm that will spread the malware to other computers in the network. The Houston State University recreated the WannaCry ransomware to understand it more. They learned that through the download of one file, it will download multiple other files to create the whole WannaCry ransomware (Jones and Shashidhar).  Some of the files creates the list of decrypted files and encrypted files. Another creates the process of encryption of files.  The program replaces and modifies the registry that focuses on taking control of the system. The WannaCry ransomware is quite complex and was hard to completely reverse engineer the software.

<h2>The Effects of Ransomeware on the Newspaper industry</h2>
<p>
  The effects of ransomware can be devastating to companies because it creates collateral damage to the company.  The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and the Tribune were all affected by ransomware.  A ransomware called Ryuk disrupted the printing plant of all three publishers’ printing operation (Sanger and Perlroth).  The ransomware caused the printing plant to deliver 20,000 copies of the New York Times a day late. The attack hindered the movement of files in the office that is essential in the printing process. The group who spread the ransomware earned a payout of $380,000 in that month.  Not only is the payment of the ransom a lost in money, but also the effects of being hindered results in more money being lost.
