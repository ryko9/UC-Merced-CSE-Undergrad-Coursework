     <!-- Introduction -->

    <h2> What is Malware? </h2>

    <p> 

      Malware is a term coined from combining the words 'malicious' and 'software'. Like its name suggests, Malware refers to any software that is created with the malicious intent to harm systems through their operating systems or through stealing personal and sensitive information. As defined by G. McGraw and G. Morrisett, Malware can be defined as "any code added, changed, or removed from a software system in order to intentionally cause harm or subvert the intended function of the system" (A Survey on Malware and Malware Detection Systems, Imtithal A. Saeed). Malware can gather user information without permission, and even spread over networks to infect other systems. With the growth in Internet and Technology use this past decade, users are more susceptible than ever to malware that can compromise their personal information.

    <!-- Malware Type Section -->

    <h2> Types of Malware</h2>

      <p>

        In order to better understand Malware, we can classify malware depending on the ways that they attack and spread to systems.

      </p>

      <h2> Network-based Malware</h2>

        <p> Network-based Malware refers to types of malware that use the network and the internet to either spread or obtain information from systems. The following examples of malware can be classified as network: 

          <ul>

            <li> <u>Adware</u>: Automatically play unwanted advertisements to users browsing the web to profit the person that wrote the adware. Adware can be especially dangerous since spyware such as keyloggers can be included in the adware to record the keystrokes and personal information of victims.</li>
    
            <li> <u>Backdoors</u>: Also known as trap doors, Backdoors are malicious code written into software applications and programs that can grant hackers remote access to the systems of victims without any authentication required.</li>0

            <li> <u>Sniffers</u>: Sniffers intercept network traffic to decode the raw data over networks to steal sensitive information. </li>

          </ul>         

        </p>

      <h2> Ordinary Malware </h2>

        <p> 

          Ordinary Malware refers to types of malware that manipulate the local file system of computers to attack. The following examples of malware can be classified as ordinary:

          <ul>

            <li> <u>Worms</u>: Computer worms are a type of malware that have the ability to self-replicate on systems to spread faster.</li>
    
            <li> <u>Logic bombs</u>: Logic bombs are programs that wait until specific conditions are met in a system to activate. Conditions like date and time can be used by logic bombs to determine when to execute, independent of network connection.</li>

          </ul>

        </p>

    <h2> Malware Detection: How can we find malware on systems? </h1>
      <p>
        
        Similar to how scientists create vaccines to combat new viruses, anti-malware developers are constantly writing software to keep track of new malware programs and identify them. The techniques they use to detect malware are essential for keeping up with new malware programs. Malware detection techniques can be split up into three classifications:

        <ul> 

          <li> <u> Heuristic based techniques </u>: Heuristic based detection systems use artificial intelligence and neural networks to approximate and predict changes in malware over time, using principles of evolutionary biology such as mutation and inheritance.

          <li> <u> Signature-based techniques </u>: Signature-based detection systems use a database of known virus signatures to help with identifying viruses. The main disadvantage of this is that malware using newer technologies can be hard to identify when comparing to the database.

          <li> <u> Anomaly-based techniques </u>E: Anomaly-based detection systems try to identify unusual or irregular activity on computer systems that may be caused by malicious software. Anomaly-based systems try to analyze patterns in computer activity to identify anomalous system behavior.


        </ul>
      </p>

    <h2> Malware Detection Technologies </h2>

      <p>
        
      In addition to heuristic, signature, and anomaly based techniques there are many prevalent forms of Malware Detection technologies. Some examples of existing technologies that are widely used today:

      <li> <u> Network-based intrusion detection systems </u>: Network-based intrusion detection systems, also known as IDS, use analysis of network node packets to monitor traffic for any out of ordinary network activity


      <li> <u> Hybrid intrusion detection systems </u>: This type of IDS uses both host-based and network-based techniques to monitor and gather information on networks.

      <li> <u> Application protocol-based intrusion detection systems (APIDS) </u>: A type of IDS that uses its resources mainly on monitoring specific application protocols. APIDS are used between web servers and database management systems, monitoring SQL protocols.

    <h2> Conclusion </h2>

    Knowing the types of malware that are prevalent today can be extremely beneficial to users looking to protect themselves from malicious software. Understanding how different types of malware infiltrate and attack systems/networks is key to preparing appropriate defense technologies. Through this informational page, my hope is that people will be able to learn more about how malware works and what tools/software exist to combat them.
