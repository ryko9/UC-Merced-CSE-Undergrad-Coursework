<h2>What is Trojan Horse?</h2>
	<p>Trojan mimics the classical trojan story that that is a decoy horse giftwrapped to hide its true intentions. This type of malware can damage your computer, but it only happens if you let it into your computer. The malware presents itself as something that you might need, persuading you to download it, only to unknowingly let it wreak havoc on your computer.</p>
	<p>Once installed they can begin to affect your computer with or without you noticing. They can do many things like create back doors and spy on the user, or completely shutdown the user’s computer.</p>
	<p>Depending on the system, there are trojans for almost everything such as video game consoles and phones.</p>

<h3>How does Trojan get into your computer?</h3>
	<p>You are typically tricked into downloading it somehow. Once installed it will ask for certain permissions such as <strong>"Allow this software to make changes to your computer?"</strong> and since people tend to just click 'agree' their computer is now in control of an attacker.</p>
	<p>Just like the Greeks used a trojan horse to trick the people of Troy into letting troops into the city, Trojan disguises itself to get into your system.</p>
	<p>Another form of infection could be through email/notifications which pretend to be someone or something it is not.</p>


<h3>Types of Trojans</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Backdoor Trojans</strong> (open doors for hackers to enter)</li>
	<li><strong>Downloader Trojans</strong> (downloads software from sites to extend control)</li>
	<li><strong>Rootkit Trojans</strong> (installs hidden hacking toolkit)</li>
	<li><strong>Mailfinder Trojans</strong> (spam email)</li>
	<li><strong>DDoS Trojans</strong> (takes over your system to go on other victims)</li>
	<li><strong>Banking Trojans</strong> (looks for financials to take)</li>
	<li><strong>Ransomware Trojans</strong> (demands ransom to decrypt files taken)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Real Examples</h3>
<ul>
	<li><em>"Rakhni"</em></li>
	<ul>
	<li>A program that typically targets systems that have cryptocurrency software. It finds victim, encrypts their files, and then demands ransom to decrypt encrypted files.</li>
	</ul>
	<br />
	<li><em>"Storm Worm"</em></li>
	<ul>
	<li>Despite the "worm" in the name, it is not a worm but a Trojan that spread through emails in the '00s.</li>
	</ul>
	<br />
	<li><em>"Zeus"</em></li>
	<ul>
	<li>A keylogger that stole banking credentials in the early '10s.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Important Things to Remember</h3>
	<p>Trojan is one of the most common forms of malware. It sneaks into your system, let in by the user, then begins to attack your system. These attacks can be straight forward or can go completely undetected for a period of time. Trojan has the potential to access and take; login info, screenshots, system info, banking info., and other sensitive info.</p>
	<p>Always consider the saying,
	<ul>
	<strong>“Always beware Greeks – or strangers online – bearing gifts.”</strong></p>
	</ul>
