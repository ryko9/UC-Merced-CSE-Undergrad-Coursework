<h2 style="background-color:Red;">What is a Firewall?</h2>
<p>  A firewall is a network security device which monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and permits or blocks data packets which are based on a set of security rules. The purpose is to create a barrier between someones internal network and incoming from traffic from external sources which are ordered to block malicious traffice like virsuse and hackers. Firewall help keep viruses or malware away from the devices which are being used on the wifi and help stop the viruses. Firewall has been improved throughout the years and have created new ways on how the firewall can benefit the users.</p>
<h3 style="background-color:Red;">Different types of Friewalls.</h3>
<p> There are different types of firewalls that are used depending on the type of business or use of firewalls in someones home and business. The four different type of firrewalls are next- generation firewalls, Proxy firewalls, Network address translation(NAT) firewalls, and Stateful multilayer inspection (SMLI) firewalls.
<li> Next-Generation firewalls- These combine a traditional firewall technology with additional functionality. This would be encrypted traffic inspection, intruion prevention systems, anit-virus, and many more. This would also include deep packet inspection. Another category which would be a distrubuted firewall as well. A distrubited firewall are host-resident security which help protect enterprise network's servers and end-user machines against unwanted intrusion.
<li>Proxy firewalls- A filter network traffic at the application level. Unlkie basic firewalls, the proxy acts as an intermediary between two end systems.
<li> Network address translation- The NAT allows multiple devices with independent netwok addresses to connect to the internet using a single IP address keeping individual IP addresses hidden.
<li> Stateful multilayer inspection firewalls- This is a filter packet at the network, transport, and application layers, comparing them against known tursted packets. Like NGFW firewalls, SMLI also examine the entire packet and only allow them to pass if they pass each layer individually.

<h3 style="background-color:Red;">How a Firewall works</h3>
<p> A firewall is a barrier to keep destuctive forces away from your property. This a program or hardwar which filters the internet connection into your private network or computer system. If there is an incoming packet of information is flagged by the filters, it is not allowed through to your network. 
<li> Packet filtering- Packets are analyzed a set of filters. Packets that make it through the filters are sent to the requesting system and all others are discareded
<li>Proxy service- Information from the Internet is retireced by the firewall and then sent to the requestion system and vice versa.
<li>Stateful inspection- A newr method which doesn't examine the cntents of each packet to a database of trusted information. 
<p> There are a variety of firewall configurations as well which are used to protect from malware. The two configuration are domain and IP address. The IP address is an assigned a unique address used for each machine. The domain names is the string of numbers that make up IP address.
<li>Internet Protocol
<li> Transmission Control Protocl
<li> Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
<li>File Transfer Protocol
<li>USer Datagram Protocol 
<li>Intenet Control Message Protocol
<li>Simple Mail Transport Protocol
<li>Simple Network Management Protocol
<li>Telnet</li>

<h4 style="background-color:Red;">Conclusion</h4>
<p> In conclusion firewall is one of the most important things to have for a system. Firewall is one of the most important things to take into account when it comes to being safe for malware.
