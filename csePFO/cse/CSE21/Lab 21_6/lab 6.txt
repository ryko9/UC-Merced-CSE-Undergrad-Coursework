Lab 6 Questions

Q1) A method is a constructor if it has no type like static or void and has the same name as the class.

Q2) No, because it has void. Instead, it would be a method.

Q3) No, because if it were private the methods could not be called from another class. If it were void, it wouldn't
return anything.

Q4) Yes, because setting the name does not require returning anything it simply assigns the argument from the method call
into the specified class variable.

Q5) Instance variables are different per object, while class variable are the same throughout the whole class/objects.

Q6) name = name would assign the value of the argument "name" into the class variable "name". However, in order to have
different names for each instance of the object you would need to use this.name = name.

Q7) You can tell by looking at the number of arguments being passed through the method call.

Q8) The dot operator allows you to access instance members of an object.

Q9) No, because there are different instances.

Q10) if (redo == 1)
    run();

If the user enters 1 to redo an order, it'll call the run method again inside of the if statement.
