Lab 8 Logic Check

Q1) declare var3 as var3 = (int)5.0; to change 5.0 from a double to an int
Q2) You need to have brackets [] after the array type. 
	int[] arri0 = {10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1};
Q3) In the else statement, the variable temp has not been initialized outside of the
if and else conditions so you need to initialize it outside in the main class.
Q4) The variable total's scope is only within the for loop, so you can't call it from
outside.
Q5) The value that is printed out is 10 because the condition is that it keeps incrementing
as long as i < 10. Since i starts at 0, the loop increments 10 times. It counts 0-1 as one loop.
Because i's scope extends to that of the entire main method it's value is kept after the loop is done.
Q6) 

A seperate object has to be created for jack. The line 
	'jack = monterey;' 
made the pointer jack reference the object monterey because no seperate object jack was created.
So monterey.getName() still returned "Monterey" until the line 
	'jack.setName("Jack");'. 
Since jack has no object and points to the object monterey, it set the name of monterey to "Jack" and 
thus when monterey.getName() was called again, it returned Jack.

This can be fixed by creating a new Cheese object for jack with no name.
	'Cheese jack = new Cheese();'
The line 'jack = monterey' is taken out because that doesn't assign the data from monterey to jack but
instead makes jack and monterey point to the same object.

Q7) 2 objects, 2 pointers.

Q8) System.out.println("Enter second number: ");
    int num2 = input.nextInt();

These lines are in both the if and else statements.

Q9) You could take the above lines out and just put them before the if and else statements since the lines will appear in both conditions anyway.

		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.print("Enter first number: ");
		int num1 = input.nextInt();
		System.out.print("Enter second number: ");
		int num2 = input.nextInt();
		
		if (num1 > var3) 
		{
			System.out.println("First is greater");
			
			if (num2 < var3)
				System.out.println("Second is Less than");
			else
				System.out.println("Second is Greater or equal");
		} 
		
		else 
		{
			System.out.println("First is Less than or equal");
			
			if (num2 < var3)
				System.out.println("Second is Less than");
			else
				System.out.println("Second is Greater or equal");

Q10) We could assign the first number the user entered into an int variable, num1. Change the if(input.nextInt() > 3) to if (num1 > 3). That way the int num1 will store the first input and we can print out num1 at the end.

Q11) Constructors dont have a variable type and have the same name as the class they're in.

Q12) What comes after the dot operator is a method of the object before the dot. Dot is used to
specify which object's method you are calling.

Q13)

There is a compile time error because dlist[0].display(); is calling the display method
for the object at index 0 of the array dlist. Since dlist[0] has not been initialized as a new
Dummy object yet the method call doesn't work. Thus, dlist[0] = new Dummy() has to come before
dlist[0].display();
