Lab 1 Logic Check

David Wang CSE 030

1.) To change the name from main to cselab enter, "mv main cselab". 

2.) When you compile g++ <source> only it doesnt make an executable.

3.) Without the line "using namespace std;", you would have to include std:: in front of cout and cin.

e.g std:cout << "Hello World";
