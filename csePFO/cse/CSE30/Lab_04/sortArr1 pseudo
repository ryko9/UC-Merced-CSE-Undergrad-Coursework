void sortArr(int isAscending, int arr[], int size)
{
	if(isAscending == 0)
	{
		selectionSort in ascending
	}
	if(isAscending == 1)
	{
		selectionSort in descending
	}
}


algorithm for ascending:

for(int i = size - 1; i > 0; i--)
{

	int max = arr[0]
	int index = 0;

	for(int j = 1; j < i + 1; j++)
	{
		if(arr[j] > arr[index])
		{
			min arr[j];
			index = j;
		}
	}

	if (index != i)
	{
		arr[index] = arr[i];
		arr[i] = min;
	}
}

algorithm for descending, 

	rename max to min,
	min is still = arr[0] and index is same

	change if (arr[j] > arr[index])

	to (arr[j] < arr[index])

only thing changed is that now the minimum number is being found
and placed at the end each time the outer for loop increments

thus, we will have all the min placed at end until entire array is
descending from start to beginning.
