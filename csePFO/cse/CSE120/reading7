5 characteristics important to our project:

- Maintainability

	This is the most important characteristic of our project because our sponsor mentioned that he needed an easy way to update information on the app such as calendars, medical information, and other personal information. Maintainability is definitely important in this case, as we would have to make information easy to upload/edit since the admins using the app won't always be tech savvy or code proficient. One way to implement this would be allowing our sponsor to upload PDFs or documents in order to have on-going calendars and information.

- Readability

	Readability is an important characteristic because it allows for our team to code more efficiently as a group. Spacing code and brackets out properly, making sure that lines aren't cluttered, and adding comments are a few examples of techniques that will ultimately make code easier to understand between our members.

- Accuracy

	Accuracy is important, since our main goal is to have a app that covers the functionality needed by our sponsor. For example, spending a lot of time on the UI will make our app pretty, but it won't cover the main functions that our users need. Focusing on implementing the two core functions of our app, check-in and location-tracking, will lead to better accuracy.

- Robustness

	Robustness is an important way to maintain efficiency while coding. Modularizing our code through functions is one way that we can isolate issues and maintain functionality even when other functions may not be working.

- Integrity

	Our app may contain sensitive information on users such as email address, weight, height, as well as medical information. Integrity is important in making sure that user information is kept private. Implementing admin credentials will ensure that only certified individuals such as doctors can see patient information, leading to better integrity.


- Bag of Testing Tricks:

Incomplete testing is the most important method of testing, as we have only so much limited time to cover possible test cases. Focusing on the test cases that are most likely to come up during usage will eliminate most day-one errors and give us more time to test while still having a working app. Data-flow testing is also especially important, as we will be able to tell which variables or data entries are causing errors.

- Korat Paper:

I think that automated testing like with Java is a double-edged sword. It makes the identification of errors easier, but also uses up more processing power and memory in the background to maintain its autonomy. Since this project is our first attempt at creating an app, I think that automated testing would not be to our benefit. It would use up precious resources and time to implement it, and also take away from our learning experience by having us rely on automatic error identification.
