Question 1:

Best case would be if everything was in increasing order from least to greatest. That way, the insert function doesnt have to make as many comparisons. Worst case would be unsorted.

Best case:


 list of [5,6,7,9], element 8. That way it goes through 5 6 7 since 8 is bigger and stops since 8 is smaller than 9.

Worst case:

list of [4, 7, 1, 10, 5] with element 8


Question 2:

Worst case would be O(n).

The first if statement is one comparison, and the else leads to recursion which is of order n

The complexity of the function is f(n) = 2n + 1

2n + 1 -> O(n)
e*n > 2n + 1, n > n_0
3n > 2n + 1, n > n_0
2n + n > 2n + 1
n > 1
2n + 1 -> O(n) for all n > 1

Question 3:

The order of complexity for overall is O(n^2)
