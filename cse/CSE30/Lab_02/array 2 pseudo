	reversing strings

a b c -> c b a 
0 1 2    2 1 0  indexes





string input; //input to be reversed
string reverse; //the reversed version of input

output: Enter the string to reverse: 

input: The reverse of the string is:

for (int i = input - 1; i >= 0; i--)
{
	reverse += input[i];
}

output: reverse




ex: David

for loop would start with "d" and add that to reverse.
"d" is at input.length - 1 since we count from 0
for loop would start from input.length - 1 and decrement until we get to 0. 

index 0 D  
index 1 a
index 2 v
index 3 i
index 4 d

input.length would be 5 in the case of david.

so the for loop would start at index 4, or input.length - 1. It would then go up until 0.

i = 4 d, reverse += d
i = 3 a, reverse += i
i = 2 v, reverse += v
i = 1 i, reverse += a
i = 0 d, reverse += D

input = "David"
reverse = "divaD"
