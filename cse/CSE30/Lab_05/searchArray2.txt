searchArray2 pseudo



Only difference in this should be the binarySearchL which uses loops instead of recursion to do binary search

int binarySearchL(string*A, int first, int last, string key)
{

	while(first <= last) //loop breaks if last ends up bigger than first or equal to first to prevent infinite loop
	(

		int middle = (first + last)/2;		

		if(key = A[middle])
			return middle; //found at middle
		else if (key < A[middle]) //if key less than middle
			last = middle - 1; //narrows search down, next loop will go from 0 to middle - 1 since we know key is less than
							and not equal to middle
		else //if key greater than middle
			first = middle + 1; //narrows search down, next loop will go from middle + 1 to last since we know key is greater than
							and not equal to middle 		
	)

	return -1; //returns -1 if nothing is found.
}




based on code from: http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~wagner/CS3343/recursion/binsearch.html

int binarysearch(int len, int a[], int x) {
   int low = 0;
   int high = len - 1;
   while (low <= high) {
      int mid = (low + high) / 2;
      if (a[mid] == x) return mid;
      else if (a[mid] < x) low = mid + 1;
      else high = mid - 1;
   }
   return -1;
}
