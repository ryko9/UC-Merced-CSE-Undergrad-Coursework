## 1. Major and classes.

**Major:** Computer Science and Engineering

**Courses:** 

1. 13797 CSE-100
2. 10132 MATH-032
3. 14919 GASP-036A
4. 10195 ENGR 191
5. 10169 CSE-005

## 2. Why are you enrolled in Math 32? What are you hoping to learn and gain? (Please supply an answer that is more in-depth than "This course fulfills my statistics requirement".)

I am enrolled in Math 32 because this class fulfills my stats requirement. And I wanted to avoid the other Math 32 professor. I hoping to learn more of the R language since I am a programmer. Also, learning stats won't be too bad.

## 3.In 2-3 sentences, type a science fact that you find fascinating into a code block (with the parameter echo = TRUE). Remember to comment out the sentences (#) so that the words are not treated as code.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell. We can't live without it.
```

## 4.Spend about 5 minutes typing out your answer to "What are you hopes and goals?" as a bullet-point list.  Do not worry about grammar; just type fast.

*Get a job in the computer science field
*Get a nice car
*Build a nice gaming desktop

## 5.Spend about 5 minutes typing out your answer to "What are your fears and obstacles?" into a code block (with the parameters "echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE" so that you do not show this part to your TA).

```{r , echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
the fear of dying alone
all the unknowns in my life that will happen
anything comp sci related that I will face
```

## 6. What is a good, lively song to add to a class playlist?  Place the song title between asterisks (*) to italicize the song title.  (Beyond profanity, please avoid offensive content.)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
