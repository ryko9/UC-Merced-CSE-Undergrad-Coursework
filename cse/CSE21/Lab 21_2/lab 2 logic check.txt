Lab 2 Logic Check


1.) The lab took me about four hours to finish because I couldn't understand the concept of winning at 8 1/2 innings if the home team already had more points after the visiting
team went for the first half of the ninth inning. However, after drawing it out and tracing I was able to understand a lot better how my loops should have worked and what my
conditions should have been set to.

2.) The return datatype of gameIsOver() is boolean, because the method was defined as a boolean return type. When gameIsOver returns false, the game has not ended yet.

3.) inning    batter  Which score is greater?     gameIsOver() will return
