Lab 12 Logic Check

9.4.1
1.) Scanner inSS = new Scanner(myStrLine); 
2.) PrintWriter outSS = new PrintWriter(simpleStream); 
3.) myStr = simpleStream.toString(); 

9.5.1
1.) The filestream has not been properly opened.
2.) obFS = new FileOutputStream("outfile.txt");
3.) outFS = new PrintWriter(obFS);
4.) outFS.print("apples");


Task 1
1.) Each arraylist element is of type String
2.) One object is created in line 4
3.) Two pointers are used in line 4, Scanner and FileReader.
4.) next() only reads input up until a space, whereas nextLine()
reads until the end of the line
5.) nextLine() is used to read until the end of the line. Delimiter "[\\s]" makes it
so next() ignores whitespace.
6.) FileNotFoundException happens when the file with the specified pathname
does not exist.
7.) NoSuchElementException occurs when you call next but the scanner
no longer has a next element to provide, so it cannot perform input.next()
8.) useDelimiter ignores the characters in the brackets
9.) + and -
10.) Pointer is returned\

Task 3
1.) input.useDelimiter("[\t\r]");
2.) to handle multiple words, you need nextLine();
